By Ferdinand Swart:

Tree Coin would be a distributed currency to the benefit of the global climate and of cash-poor rural communities worldwide.

## TREE COIN
Why NOW? Because it’s possible!
IT and system development brought us a scala of new technologies, to learn from and to combine:
Blockchain		to secure transactions and registration
DAO, Dash		how to control operation by the users
Microfinance		how to use group control + monitoring
Cyclos.org		how to code pro-poor banking software
M-PESA		how to distribute money by mobile phone
GPS + photo		how to register a location
Satellite pictures	to monitor land-use change
AirBnB		how to do ratings and self promotion
Serious Games	to use attractive reward systems 
Wikipedia		how to run a “solution wiki” and “location wiki”
Fair.coop		to cooperate with other groups to build a parallel economy
Design thinking 	how to design online integrated projects location
Etc.

Combining these techniques should open new path, an efficient way to reach to the margins of this world and open a venue for all to get some cash income without migrating. And save the climate.

### TreeCoin 
- Goals & Potential uses
- Value of crypto currencies
- Tree Credits tokens
- Value of TreeCoin
- Minting new coins
- Limit to potential Qt coins
- Conversion to fiat money

**Goals & Potential uses**
The next step in our (TCF) quest to solve climate change and poverty in one go, is to create a land-use based crypto coin + token with 3 functions:
- to reward volunteers for climate smart social work
- to use as local currency in under resourced local economies
Should be backed by a banking platform hardwired to favor the poor.

**A social Coin might be needed for:**
To stimulate local economies, to the benefit of the poorest producers
To be able to reward (debt free, cross border) those who help to reach a sustainable world
To enable issuing of debt free loans and insurances and simplify procedures
To enable international project cooperation and trade
Empowering marginal groups by opening new venues of income and cooperation.
As an intermedium, a currency facilitating exchange from tokens to hard cash.

I envision a scala of tokens to span the void in reward between $ wages and none for volunteering work, including within the family. The tree coin as well as the treecredits tokens could play a central role in this mix and also might serve as a linking currency and to facilitate exchange of tokens into fiat money.

2) **A crypto coin**, like bitcoin don’t need a bank because transactions are recorded  in a distributed (crowd managed) ledger and secured in a public “blockchain”.
This makes transactions more efficient and cheap. Serious security issues remain. 
The exchange value of cryptocurrencies mainly depends on the number of transactions, the number of users which trust it enough to put their savings in or to speculate on its rise. Bitcoin as the first mover will reign supreme for the foreseeable future and all later one must offer new uses, improved security and ownership; and even then, most tend to peter out after an initial hype. 

New coins now often come with a blockchain platform which offer more services,
Ethereum, Synereo and soon NXT’s Ardor offer a platform on which various apps might run and on which new coins can be created; Steemit offer payment for content and DAO and DASH offer development and power by the users. None succeeded to balance trust, autonomy and possibilities and it not sure that beyond the hypes are clever ponzi schemes. Only very few will be used enough and build a viable economy. Tree Coins should function as the alternative needed.

3) **Tree Credits tokens**
Tree Credits tokens could be paid monthly to reward “ecosystem services”. They are not freely convertible into fiat money, but can be used for:
To pay for school fees, in clinics and in some food stores if they have an agreement with TCTrust fund
To pay for services and goods on offer online priced in TCtokens
To use as reserve money in the local economy
To transfer into TreeCoin, which is fiat money covertible, if strict conditions apply


4)**Intrinsic value of Tree Coins: positive land use.**
Each TCoin might be labelled with the GPS coordinates of a piece of land (10 x 10m, enough to plant 10 trees) used in climate smart and social way. Best is carbon negative land where  carbon is stored in the soil and in wood, like in (agro)-forestry, organic agriculture. Carbon positive climate measures include: trees growing/ food forests/  organic agr./ parks/ cycle paths/ green roofs/ urban gardens/ solar panels.
The TreeCoin can be freely circulated and the value is not related to the original location. 
This registration of land-use has many side functions: for Tree Credits claims, Carbon Credit claims and future land ownership.

5) **Minting new coins**
Each location allows minting one TreeCoin as well as one TreeCreditsTokens every 10 years. This TCTs go into a Trust Fund and will be used to help to maintain the location for 10 years and to defend the positive status of the area actively.

As described above coins are minted by registering places which have positive land-use; this is usually done by making a photo with GPS coordinates + time/date inscripted. In nature reserves, if the local, indigenous people ask for help and protection, we might work with satellite pictures. All coordinates will be plotted on a public map.
There should be a storage of approved locations, of potential coins to be minted when they need to be brought into circulation (for payments and loans, etc.)   

6) **The number of TreeCoins will be limited to the climate smart area registered**, in the end limited by the total land available. So the total of Coins will be limited to the amount of land restored or still in tact; together good for about 2 x 10*11 Coins (or 2 trillion trees, 10 trees per coin).
Plus the tokens issued for maintenance services which could potentially double the amount over 10 years if they get issued and eventually exchanged.





### Appendix 1 How to stimulate a local economy using a crypto coin:

Ways to bring Coins into circulation include: 1) monthly payments to land carers (see TreeCredits), 2) signup bonuses for new members, 3) all loans issued 4) to reward other climate positive actions with real impact, think publicity, fund raising, management, education, etc. (see theGoodGame)
Besides creating an cross border tool, a major goal of the coin is to provide a ready made template to create a local currency and if it get widely circulated, might greatly stimulate the local economy to the benefit of poor, women, children.
Living in a remote village there should be possibilities to get Coins, like: 1) sign up to Coin- or Tree Credits scheme; 2)  bonus for registration of a carbon positive location; 3) as monthly reward for landcare 4) as small loans; 5) as insurance pay 6) for volunteering online; 7) for organising local projects etc. 
Sectors suitable to pay with local Coins include schools, local produce and products, eating houses and bakeries, hotels, services and some national products.
Shops should be stimulated to accept the Coin by offering them bonuses and small interest free loans, if they advertise a “Coin accepted” sign. 
Small objects should be available online like smart phones, solar panels and seeds.
To safeguard the circulation of a “local” coin all parties involved should  balance income and expenses. Especially if used crossborder we should be sure the Coin doesn’t get stuck at one side, location or sector. 
Transaction Fees, how to stimulate local economy 
Each transaction might carry two small fees, one half is for the computer costs, the other half goes toward the land carer. (or by micro money creation)
To stimulate its use each transaction of the coin will result in the creation of new coins to compensate for transaction fees + bonus.
Hoarding the coin could be discouraged by charging monthly negative interest.
In all there might be 3 mechanisms to stimulate circulation and thus the local economy and income: 1) conditions for exchange 2) negative monthly interest 3) bonus new shares, given for transaction for goods and services.

Exchange into other currency, a pro-income scenario:
There will be a coin exchange and the coins can be changed under specific conditions. There are 2 major conditions: 1) how often used in a transaction 2) time passed since last transaction or issuing time. For instance the rule might apply that the coin can be exchange for local cash only a week after it is used once. This to guarantee the teacher or shopkeepers the value of the coin but still stimulate its frequent use.
If time and/ or usage restrictions for exchange apply, there will be 2 kinds of (digital) Coins: Coins which can be exchanged and Coins that can not. Accordingly your Coin account might show 2 separate amounts.
Starting communities might have a circulation restrictions of only one usage, but in mature setting, where most shops and even local officials except the Coin this could rise to seven times using.
In this case, after 7 transactions your account will show the amount of the smallest transaction as exchangeable and with every new transaction the next lowest amount will be added.
The international Exchange Rates (including conditions) could be set by a Coin’s Board against a basket of World Currencies; considering longer term market development projections as well. This to keep the value stable. 
Local circumstances will call for tailor made rules of exchange for which we might provide protocols, how to design and start a village exchange.

### Appendix 2: Some History: A common currency that works (unlike the Euro)

During the second world war Keynes developed a system of international money issued by a global bank, the ICU (international clearing union) to conduct international trade. If a country exported some it's ICU saldo went up, if the country imported some, it went down. To balance the system he proposed each country had a limit how much it could go in the red, where after it had to devalue its currency to make their exports more attractive. And they had to pay interest; but also the surplus countries had to pay 5-10% interest on their surplus to stimulate them into importing. So everybody would be interested to balance its trade.
We will use these principles to run any local currency.

### Appendix 3 some catchy phrases:
 (concerning both the proposed Coin and banking platform, needed to run it in a social way)

Functions of the software needed:
1) To reach out to all, wherever, even without ID, by mobile phone. Registration persons + agents, registration locations, payments, support.
2) To check and secure: blockchain, photo + GPS, peer control, agent visit, travelers visit, satellite images for land use and biomass change
3) To manage by the crowd, gamification to be able to reward, motivate and manage the crowd
4) To prosper and expand, by crowd marketing and fundraising
5) To educate; from infotainment, to various wikis, to online courses
6) To plan and design online, together
7) To cooperate with all like minded orgs, to share platform, payment facilities and tree coin.
8) To defend the expanding parallel economie

Some populist (potential) slogans:
Beat the banks, let's start our own money and better banking system.
Let's side wing EU, UN and governments and reward those who deserve it, where ever they are, directly.

Now we should think of slogans attractive to the youth and get them coding to make it possible; to create a platform to allow action. To bring hope, meaning and guidance to the youth with simple messages like:

LET'S CREATE OUR OWN GLOBAL CRYPTO CURRENCY.
to outwing the now unsustainable banking system
to reward volunteers and positive climate actions 
(a small coin a month for each tree planted)
to stimulate cash poor communities
to make interest free loans possible
to raise those in need out of poverty
to open a venue for anyone with phone to earn a sustainable income
to allow private initiatives and social enterprises to meet and to cooperate
